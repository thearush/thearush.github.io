      <p class="description">
        I love everything to do with programming! Having an affinity for
        technology since a young age, my world opened up when I discovered
        programming. With programming, my imagination is the limit. The only
        limit on my progress is myself, and that is incredibly empowering. In my
        free time, I love to pursue many cool and interesting ideas and bring
        them to life through code. You can see some of my projects below!
        <br /><br />
        Outside of programming, I love watching anime, playing video games,
        riding my bike, and reading horror and fantasy novels.

          <p class="desc">
            Zap is a multi-purpose, robust Discord bot that I designed to make
            discord servers more interactable and lively. <br />
            <br />
            Zap has many features, including trivia, fun facts, custom embeds,
            and responsive behavior. I plan to add even more features to make
            zap even more versatile and interactive in the context of a discord
            server. <br />
            <br />
            This bot was uniquely fun to code because I learned to interact with
            an external API to display trivia questions for the bot, and I look
            forward to working more on it in the future!

          <h3 class="subhead">Warp</h3>
          <p class="desc">
            Warp is a custom, concise, and robust programming language that I am
            developing along with a friend in C++. <br />
            <br />
            Warp is designed in C++, rather than Java or Python because of its
            core emphasis on speed. We want warp to have both speed and
            simplicity, which is rare in modern programming languages.<br />
            <br />
            Developing Warp has been a unique challenge due to the complex and
            interweaving factors that must be considered in developing a fully
            functional programming language, and I hope to continue and carve
            this language as my vision sees it.

          <h3 class="subhead">The Platformist</h3>
          <p class="desc">
            The Platformist is a custom, original, and robust video game that I
            made from scratch using Java and Swing. <br />
            <br />
            The Platformist is a fun and interactive video game that challenges
            the player with a series of increasingly difficult obstacles. The
            player goes through a series of levels, focusing on reaching the end
            of each level and winning the game. I built The Platformist from
            scratch with custom physics and rendering.<br />
            <br />
            The Platformist was one of my first graphical applications, and it
            was extremely educational. I learned how to render graphics and how
            to design large-scale projects in a smooth manner. Developing the
            game was very fun, and I am very satisfied with the result. I hope
            to make similar applications in the future for fun!

          <h3 class="subhead">Checkers</h3>
          <p class="desc">
            This is a faithful replica of the classic game of Checkers, written
            from scratch in Java using JavaFX.<br />
            <br />
            This version of Checkers is very robust, responsive, and crisp in
            quality. I took care to design the mechanics and graphics to have a
            picturesque quality. The game's graphics are rendered through
            JavaFX, and the game has audio along with serialization
            functionality. Furthermore, the game has a custom computer bot that
            plays against the player, which uses a difficult heuristic algorithm
            with high success rates, even against good players.<br />
            <br />
            Making the game was very fun, as I was already very experienced in
            programming when I approached it. I employed a systematic approach
            for the game's design, and everything went smoothly and according to
            plan. The game provided a good test of my skills and it allowed me
            to further my skills in the areas of graphics and serialization, as
            I used JavaFX and the google GSON library for the first time.
